I have tried ElastiCache and test for my environment. We're trying to use it but we should test it before buying the real instances for production.

After launching some instances, I try to delete them when the test is finished. But it fail! The warning message said "it's a invalid requests" and I can't delete them after trying more than 10 times.

So I have no idea how to handle it. And a month later, the billing says it cost me $561.48 which is really beyond my expectation. I want my money back and help to improve your quality of services.
