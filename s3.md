# S3

## Roadmap

Server-side encrption and SSE with customer-provided keys(only ASE algorithm). But not for stream.

Lifecicle control of version and ttl. Control to delete 7 days can restore.

Event notification. SMS message to push, SQS queue to pull, lambda. Per bucket and per prefix in  the future. 20~30ms 99%. Notification containers request id, checksum, not sure about the versons, request header, response header and md5.

S3 virtual private network for sepecified ec2. Accelete and let AWS manages security.

Replication asynchronously. Can replication synchronous in client with SDK. Set s3 0 day for gliter. Can move object right now and not charge for s3 but requests.

Not sla for latency, only for available. First byte latency. Clients are different. 16k serval ms. 10 ms 99% with 100k qps. Mainly for scale up.

Always use prefix. For large scale, should use random not prefix. No implement detail. Life cycle for each object in meta data.

Discount for DynamoDB. Dynamo is the right thing for meta data.

Next ec2 has not storage. S3 can't append and do it locally. Iops is much cheaper than EBS. SSD through is good enouth.

S3 qps through limitation. The bigger of objects and the larger of throught to optimize throught. Pinterest 1PB per day and 10GB per second from s3 to ec2.

Charge requests and free to upload and download from private network, but not free for Internet.

11 9th for object replia, disk raid and repair time of disk failure.

Support contionaly write.

No consistency.

16kb piece and 4M object.

No limitation of throught. Some one uses a lot which may has a effect of others. Can limit some one. Increase the through and assure others. Charge extra to limit. Not a good experience.

S3 throughting is just get.

2012 2T objects.

842 hard disks in one cluster.

Many ways to detect the error of disk. Tool to request the disk. No repsonse or long-time response. Very aggressive to determine if the disk works.

Rack download to replication and avoid report effect. The copy of objects can pervent the project in one house.

Multi-part to upload and commit. Need a token to show it's done.

Multi-part require 5M part. It can't continue to upload.

Many reviews. Update in single cluster one by one. Measure each metrics in realtime.

No testing make the product bad. 100% test in live servers.
